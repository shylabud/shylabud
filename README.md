## 👋 Hi, I'm Shyla 
### 🎓 Sophomore at St. John's University, studying Cybersecurity
### 🌟 Passionate about Machine Learning, and Research Collaboration

My journey with the technology world beyond playing games on my parents phone began, in elementary school through an afterschool coding program. Since then, I've only grown more within the field, such as not only beginning my journey with cybersecurity, but having expanded my skills in different programming languages. 

At St. John’s, I developed a foundation in cybersecurity. I’ve worked with configuring small networks, troubleshooting connectivity, and creating IPv4 and IPv6 addressing schemes. I also earned a Cisco certificate for completing the “Introduction to Networks” course.

Although Cybersecurity can be considered a more _specific_ major, I have always been keen on learning and gaining experience in different areas of the entire technological field. Currently, I am learning and growing my skillset with Machine Learning through as a Fellow with [Break Through Tech](https://www.breakthroughtech.org/).

Applying my knowledge to real world situations, and collaborating on projects that bridge technology and business impact is an underlying goal of mine. I’m always looking for ways to learn and grow within the evolving tech industry.
